This project adapts concepts from the [Gemini FullStack LangGraph Quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart) for the frontend app.

This project is based on the original [Gemini Fullstack Agent Development Kit (ADK) Quickstart](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/gemini-fullstack).

## üöÄ Getting Started: From Zero to Running Agent in 1 Minute
**Prerequisites:** **[Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**, **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**, **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**

You have two options to get started. Choose the one that best fits your setup:

*   A. **[Google AI Studio](#a-google-ai-studio)**: Choose this path if you want to use a **Google AI Studio API key**. This method involves cloning the sample repository.
*   B. **[Google Cloud Vertex AI](#b-google-cloud-vertex-ai)**: Choose this path if you want to use an existing **Google Cloud project** for authentication. This method generates a new, prod-ready project using the [agent-starter-pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) including all the deployment scripts required.

---

### A. Google AI Studio

You'll need a **[Google AI Studio API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)**.

#### Step 1: Clone Repository
Clone the repository and `cd` into the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
cd adk-samples/python/agents/gemini-fullstack
```

#### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `app` folder by running the following command (replace YOUR_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY with your actual API key):

```bash
echo "GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE" >> app/.env
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY" >> app/.env
```

#### Step 3: Install & Run
From the `gemini-fullstack` directory, install dependencies and start the servers.

```bash
make install && make dev
```
Your agent is now running at `http://localhost:5173`.

---

### B. Google Cloud Vertex AI

You'll also need: **[Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)** and a **Google Cloud Project** with the **Vertex AI API** enabled.

#### Step 1: Create Project from Template
This command uses the [Agent Starter Pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) to create a new directory (`my-tiny-tastes-app`) with all the necessary code.
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the starter pack and create your project
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create my-tiny-tastes-app -a adk_gemini_fullstack
```
<details>
<summary>‚ö°Ô∏è Alternative: Using uv</summary>

If you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, you can create and set up your project with a single command:
```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-tiny-tastes-app -a adk_gemini_fullstack
```
This command handles creating the project without needing to pre-install the package into a virtual environment.
</details>

You'll be prompted to select a deployment option (Agent Engine or Cloud Run) and verify your Google Cloud credentials.

#### Step 2: Install & Run
Navigate into your **newly created project folder**, then install dependencies and start the servers.
```bash
cd my-tiny-tastes-app && make install && make dev
```
Your agent is now running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment
> **Note:** The cloud deployment instructions below apply only if you chose the **Google Cloud Vertex AI** option.

You can quickly deploy your agent to a **development environment** on Google Cloud. You can deploy your latest code at any time with:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_DEV_PROJECT_ID with your actual Google Cloud Project ID
gcloud config set project YOUR_DEV_PROJECT_ID
make backend
```

## How the Agent Thinks: A Multi-Agent Workflow for Baby Food Recipes

The backend, defined in `app/agent.py`, uses a series of specialized agents to help users create safe and healthy baby food recipes.

The following diagram illustrates the agent's architecture and workflow:

![Tiny Tastes App Architecture](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/agent-starter-pack/blob/main/docs/images/adk_gemini_fullstack_architecture.png?raw=true)

The process involves several key agents:

1.  **`interactive_recipe_agent` (Root Agent):**
    *   **Description:** The primary assistant for creating baby food recipes. It collaborates with the user to generate a recipe and then gets it approved before finalization.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  **Generate Recipe:** When the user provides ingredients or a recipe name, it calls the `recipe_generator`.
        2.  **Present for Approval:** Shows the generated recipe to the user for their initial approval.
        3.  **Delegate to Pipeline:** If the user approves, it passes the recipe to the `recipe_creation_pipeline` for detailed review and refinement.

2.  **`recipe_generator`:**
    *   **Description:** Generates a creative and simple toddler food recipe (1-2 years old) based on user input (ingredients or recipe name).
    *   **Output:** A `Recipe` object containing the title, description, ingredients, instructions, and age appropriateness.

3.  **`recipe_creation_pipeline` (Sequential Agent):**
    *   **Description:** Manages the iterative refinement of the recipe.
    *   **Sub-agents:**
        *   **`iterative_refinement_loop` (Loop Agent):**
            *   **`pediatrician_critic_agent`:** Evaluates the current recipe for safety, nutritional value, and age-appropriateness. Outputs a `PediatricianFeedback` object with a "pass" or "fail" grade, comments, and follow-up questions if it fails.
            *   **`EscalationChecker`:** Checks the pediatrician's feedback. If the recipe "passes", it stops the loop.
            *   **`recipe_refiner_agent`:** If the recipe "fails", this agent uses the pediatrician's feedback and Google Search (for the follow-up questions) to revise and improve the recipe.
        *   **`final_recipe_presenter_agent`:** Once the recipe passes the pediatrician's review, this agent formats the final, approved recipe into a user-friendly markdown report, including nutrition notes and safety reminders.

**Overall Flow:**

*   The user interacts with the `interactive_recipe_agent`.
*   A basic recipe is generated by `recipe_generator`.
*   The user approves this initial recipe.
*   The `recipe_creation_pipeline` takes over:
    *   The `pediatrician_critic_agent` reviews the recipe.
    *   If it fails, `recipe_refiner_agent` improves it using web research.
    *   This loop continues until the `pediatrician_critic_agent` approves the recipe (or max iterations are reached).
    *   Finally, `final_recipe_presenter_agent` creates a polished markdown report of the approved recipe.

You can edit key parameters (Gemini models, loop iterations) in the `ResearchConfiguration` (if applicable, or other config files like `app/config.py`).

## Customization

You can modify and extend this agent's behavior by editing the backend code.

*   **Modifying Agent Logic:** The core logic for all sub-agents is defined in `app/agent.py`. You can change the prompts, tools, or reasoning steps by modifying the agent definitions here.
*   **Adjusting Parameters:** Key parameters, such as the Gemini models used or the number of refinement loop iterations, can be adjusted in `app/config.py`.
*   **Syncing with Frontend:** The frontend UI integrates with the backend through specific agent names and state keys.
    Important agent/state keys include:
    * `recipe_generator`: Initial recipe creation.
    * `current_recipe`: The state key holding the recipe being worked on.
    * `pediatrician_evaluation`: The state key for the critic's feedback.
    * `final_recipe_report`: The state key for the final markdown output.
    * `interactive_recipe_agent`: Main interaction point.
    
    If you rename agents or change state key names in `app/agent.py`, you must update their references in the frontend code (`/ui`) to maintain functionality.


### Example Interaction

> **User:** Can you make a recipe with sweet potato and carrot?
>
> **Agent:** I can help with that! I've drafted a recipe called "Sunshine Puree" with sweet potato and carrot. It includes simple steps for steaming and blending these veggies. Does this look good? If so, I can have our AI pediatrician review it for safety and nutrition.
>
> **User:** Yes, that sounds great! Please proceed.
>
> *(The agent's `recipe_creation_pipeline` now starts. The `pediatrician_critic_agent` reviews the "Sunshine Puree" recipe.)*
>
> *(After a short while, if the recipe passes the review...)*
>
> **Agent:** Great news! Our AI pediatrician has reviewed the "Sunshine Puree" and it's approved! Here's the final recipe:
>
> # Sunshine Puree
> A delightful and nutritious blend of sweet potato and carrot, perfect for little ones.
> Age Appropriateness: 1-2 years
>
> ## Ingredients
> *   1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cubed
> *   2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
> *   1/4 cup water (for steaming/blending, adjust as needed)
>
> ## Instructions
> 1.  Steam the sweet potato and carrot cubes/slices until very tender (approx. 15-20 minutes).
> 2.  Allow to cool slightly.
> 3.  Transfer the cooked vegetables to a blender. Add a little water.
> 4.  Blend until smooth, adding more water a tablespoon at a time to reach desired consistency.
>
> ## Nutrition Notes
> This puree is packed with Vitamin A from both sweet potatoes and carrots, which is great for vision and immune health. Sweet potatoes also offer Vitamin C and dietary fiber.
>
> ## Safety First!
> *   Always ensure the puree is cooled to a safe temperature before serving.
> *   Ensure the texture is appropriate for your baby's age and feeding ability to prevent choking. For younger babies, a thinner puree might be needed.
